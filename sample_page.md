## Identifying Inaccessible Health Emergency Areas in the Rio Grande Valley

**Project description:** The general problem I will be focusing on in this research project is the disparities that exist within the current system and areas of hospitalization and public health in the Rio Grande Valley. This research project would entail what happens when certain areas lack the necessary infrastructure in order to support basic needs of life and how that in turn affects the health and well-being of those in the area. This topic is important based on previous research studies done, due to the rapidly growing population that exists within the area, and the level of underdevelopment the area still faces. As the population grows, this research has focused on the health quality of the area that remains a problem both historically and in modern times even with the improvement of technology.

### 1. Main Research Question

My main research question is, which areas of the Rio Grande Valley are under served by emergency hospitals? Subsequently I pose the question, how do the socio-economic characteristics of these areas compare to the serviced areas? I hope to identify the areas of inequity and discrepancy of health care in the Rio Grande Valley. This question would focus on identifying the discrepancies and inequities in the Rio Grande Valley based on both socioeconomic factors and environmental factors based on distance from the hospitals. By compiling these two characteristics in the region, I hope to discover where the areas of discrepancies exist and identify the main factors behind this inequity and discrepancy.

### 3. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments

If I were to expand on this project in the future, I’d really like to include those other possible influences, as well as those socioeconomic characteristics I have found from this study to be influential. I’d really like to know what exactly causes the public health care discrepancy within the Rio Grande Valley. I’d like to look at varying environmental factors such as housing, whether they live alone or with varying family members, lifestyle choices, accessibility to food, sewage, education, etc. I would also like to expand on my general categories such as splitting it into levels of education rather than the broad topic of just high school and college level achievements, as well as splitting up income to see where each of these counties lie in terms the income that they receive. It would provide a more in depth look at what influences the Rio Grande Valley when it comes to the discrepancy in health care coverage.
